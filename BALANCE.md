# Balance and Design Philosophy

This document explains the balance philosophy behind Eldertide Armaments and provides guidance on item power levels.

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Build-Defining Items**: Each item should enable or enhance specific character builds
2. **Meaningful Choices**: Players should feel excited about finding items and making choices about which to use
3. **Visual Identity**: Items should feel special through unique VFX and abilities
4. **Legendary Tier**: Items are designed for endgame content and should feel appropriately powerful

### Target Audience

This mod is designed for players who:

- Enjoy powerful, unique items
- Want more build variety in endgame
- Appreciate visual flair and special effects
- Play on higher difficulty settings or with other challenging mods

## Power Level Guidelines

### Comparison to Vanilla Items

Eldertide Armaments items are **intentionally more powerful** than most vanilla legendary items. Here's why:

- **Limited Slots**: Only 2 ring slots and 1 amulet slot
- **Unique Drops**: Each item spawns once per playthrough (immersive version)
- **Late-Game Focus**: Items are balanced for Act 3 and endgame content
- **Build Enablers**: Items open new gameplay possibilities rather than just providing stat boosts

### Power Tier Breakdown

#### Tier 1: Game-Changing (850-900 Value)

**Examples**: Ring 8 (Predator's Ring), Ring 9 (Stormlord's Ring)

**Characteristics**:

- Multiple powerful abilities
- Strong passive effects
- Build-defining features
- Suitable for hardest content

**Use Cases**:

- Honor Mode playthroughs
- Challenging boss fights
- Endgame optimization

#### Tier 2: Powerful (650-750 Value)

**Examples**: Ring 1 (Dragonsoul Ring), Ring 6 (Mindwarden Ring)

**Characteristics**:

- 2-3 unique abilities
- Strong passive effect
- Clear build synergies
- Impactful but not overwhelming

**Use Cases**:

- Normal Tactician gameplay
- Specialized builds
- Mid-to-late game progression

#### Tier 3: Strong (500-600 Value)

**Examples**: Ring 4 (Selune's Grace Ring), Ring 5 (Trickster's Ring)

**Characteristics**:

- 1-2 unique abilities
- Useful passive effect
- Good for specific situations
- Comparable to best vanilla items

**Use Cases**:

- Early Act 3 content
- Filling out build gaps
- Situational advantages

### Item Categories

#### Offensive Focus

Items that enhance damage output:

- **Ring 8**: Predator Precision (critical hits and assassin builds)
- **Ring 9**: Thor's Fury (strength builds, smite damage)
- **Ring 2**: Bloodborne abilities (lifesteal and vampiric builds)

**Balance**: High damage requires setup or specific builds to maximize

#### Defensive Focus

Items that enhance survivability:

- **Ring 4**: Selune's Grace (healing and AC)
- **Ring 6**: Mindwarden (psychic resistance and mind protection)
- **Amulets**: Various defensive amulets with resistance

**Balance**: Powerful defense but doesn't increase damage significantly

#### Utility Focus

Items that provide unique abilities:

- **Ring 5**: Trickster abilities (Midas Touch, sanctuary)
- **Ring 7**: Astral abilities (ethereal powers)
- **Ring 1**: Dragon heritage (flight and dragon abilities)

**Balance**: Interesting abilities with situational power

#### Hybrid Items

Items that combine multiple focuses:

- Most amulets
- High-tier rings with multiple abilities

**Balance**: Versatile but may be slightly weaker in each individual area

## Ability Design

### Spell Power Levels

#### Tier 1 Spells (Powerful)

- **Annihilation** (Ring 8): High damage, limited uses
- **Thor's Fury** (Ring 9): Area lightning damage
- **Cataclysm Blast** (Ring 3): Explosive damage

**Balance**: Limited spell slots or long cooldowns prevent spam

#### Tier 2 Spells (Strong)

- **Skybreaker Smite** (Ring 9): Enhanced smite
- **Mind Blast** (Ring 6): Control and damage
- **Logarius's Final Embrace** (Ring 2): Powerful buff

**Balance**: Strong effects with specific use cases

#### Tier 3 Spells (Situational)

- **Midas Touch** (Ring 5): Utility effect
- **Shadow's Retribution** (Ring 4): Defensive counter
- **Various Arena/Zone effects**: Control abilities

**Balance**: Useful in specific situations, not universally powerful

### Passive Abilities

#### Always-On Passives

Examples:

- **Predator Precision**: Consistent critical hit bonus
- **Unyielding Tempest**: Lightning damage on hit
- **Dark Vanish**: Stealth bonuses

**Balance**: Moderate power that stacks with build choices

#### Conditional Passives

Examples:

- **Executioner Movement**: Bonus on kill
- **Astral Surge**: Bonus in specific scenarios
- **Mindwarden**: Protection against specific damage type

**Balance**: Powerful when conditions met, situational otherwise

#### Triggered Effects

Examples:

- **Draconic Retaliation**: Counterattack
- **Heal on specific actions**: Reactive healing

**Balance**: Requires specific playstyle to maximize

## Build Synergies

### Melee Builds

**Best Items**:

- Ring 9 (Strength bonus, smite abilities)
- Ring 2 (Lifesteal, vampiric abilities)
- Ring 8 (Critical hits, assassin features)

**Power Level**: Very high with proper build
**Balance**: Requires melee range, tactical positioning

### Spellcaster Builds

**Best Items**:

- Ring 6 (Mind magic, psychic abilities)
- Ring 3 (Explosive spells)
- Various amulets with spell bonuses

**Power Level**: High spell damage and utility
**Balance**: Limited by spell slots and positioning

### Hybrid Builds

**Best Items**:

- Ring 7 (Astral abilities, physical bonuses)
- Ring 1 (Dragon heritage, flight)
- Utility amulets

**Power Level**: Versatile, good in many situations
**Balance**: Not optimal for any single role

### Tank/Support Builds

**Best Items**:

- Ring 4 (AC, healing)
- Ring 6 (Resistance, mind protection)
- Defensive amulets

**Power Level**: Excellent survivability
**Balance**: Lower damage output

## Difficulty Recommendations

### For Balanced Gameplay

#### Story/Explorer Mode

- Use **any items** - they'll make you feel powerful but not break the game
- Mix and match for fun combinations
- Focus on thematic builds

#### Balanced/Normal Mode

- Use **Tier 2-3 items** for appropriate challenge
- Tier 1 items will make content significantly easier
- Good balance of power and challenge

#### Tactician Mode

- **All items appropriate** - designed for this difficulty
- Tier 1 items provide good endgame power
- Tactical positioning still matters

#### Honor Mode

- **All items recommended** - you'll need the power
- Tier 1 items help but don't trivialize content
- Strategic use of abilities is crucial

### Self-Imposed Limitations

If items feel too powerful, consider:

1. **Limited Items**: Only use 1-2 mod items per character
2. **Thematic Builds**: Choose items that fit character concept rather than optimal picks
3. **No-Swap Rule**: Don't swap items mid-combat
4. **Delayed Access**: Don't use tutorial chest version, find items naturally
5. **Higher Difficulty**: Play on harder difficulty settings
6. **Other Challenging Mods**: Combine with difficulty-increasing mods

## Item Interactions

### Stacking Effects

**What Stacks**:

- Different types of bonuses (e.g., AC from one ring, damage from another)
- Unique spell unlocks (you get all spells from all equipped items)
- Different resistance types

**What Doesn't Stack**:

- Same ability score bonuses (highest applies)
- Similar passive effects (game rules apply)
- Duplicate resistances (one applies)

### Build Optimization

**Optimal Combinations** (examples):

1. **Critical Assassin**:
   - Ring 8 (Predator Precision)
   - Ring 5 (Dexterity bonus)
   - Dexterity-focused amulet

2. **Lightning Warrior**:
   - Ring 9 (Thor's Fury, Unyielding Tempest)
   - Strength amulet
   - Melee-focused setup

3. **Mind Mage**:
   - Ring 6 (Mindwarden, psychic abilities)
   - Ring 7 (Astral abilities)
   - Intelligence/Wisdom amulet

4. **Vampire Build**:
   - Ring 2 (Bloodborne abilities)
   - Ring 8 (Critical hits for healing)
   - Charisma amulet for blood magic

## Consumables Balance

### Potions and Elixirs

**Power Level**: Strong but limited by quantity

**Design**:

- More powerful than vanilla potions
- Limited availability (found in specific locations)
- Single-use ensures they don't trivialize content

**Use Cases**:

- Boss fights
- Critical moments
- Clutch plays

## Compatibility with Other Mods

### Power Level Considerations

**Synergizes Well With**:

- Difficulty-increasing mods
- Class expansion mods
- Enemy AI improvements
- Tactical combat mods

**May Stack Excessively With**:

- Other powerful equipment mods
- Stat-multiplying mods
- Game-breaking ability mods

**Recommendation**: Use Eldertide Armaments as your primary equipment mod or be mindful of power creep with multiple equipment mods.
