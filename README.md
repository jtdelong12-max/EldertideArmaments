## Known Issues & Solutions

### Game Version Compatibility
**Problem**: Crashes or errors with BG3 Patch 8  
**Solution**:
- Update to Eldertide Armaments version 1.6.5 or later
- Version 1.6.4 and earlier are incompatible with Patch 8 (build 6758295)

### Act 2 Yurgir Chest Loot
**Problem**: Items in chest near Yurgir in Gauntlet of Shar despawn if Yurgir is convinced to kill himself before looting  
**Workaround**:
- **Always loot the chest BEFORE triggering Yurgir's dialogue**
- If already triggered, items may be lost for that playthrough
- This is a known limitation of quest-related loot in temporary locations

### Astral Champion's Ring (Ethereal Alliance)
**Issue**: Summons from Ethereal Alliance cannot be manually dismissed  
**Note**: 
- This is intentional to prevent game freezes
- Summons will automatically expire at short rest
- **Do not attempt to manually dismiss these summons** (was causing severe lag/freeze in v1.6.3)

### Items Not Appearing
**Problem**: Items don't spawn in expected locations  
**Solutions**:
- Ensure you have the latest version installed
- Check that BG3 Mod Fixer is installed and active
- Verify your load order in BG3 Mod Manager
- Some items have RNG-based spawning (check multiple vendors/locations)
- Save and reload after visiting a location

### Duplicate Items
**Problem**: Receiving multiple copies of the same item  
**Solutions**:
- This is a known limitation of the RNG loot system
- Items should only spawn once per playthrough in the immersive version
- If using tutorial chest version, multiples are expected

### Compatibility Issues
**Problem**: Mod conflicts with other equipment mods  
**Solutions**:
- Ensure BG3 Mod Fixer is active
- Check load order - equipment mods should load after base game files
- Test with minimal mod setup to identify conflicts
- Check Nexus posts for known incompatibilities

### Installation Problems
**Problem**: Mod doesn't appear in-game after installation  
**Solutions**:
- Verify `.pak` file is in the correct Mods folder
- Use BG3 Mod Manager to properly export load order
- Check that mod UUID is correctly added to `modsettings.lsx`
- Start a new game or load a save before mod was installed

### After Game Updates
**Problem**: Mod stops working after BG3 patch  
**Solutions**:
- Check Nexus Mods page for compatibility updates
- Download the latest version compatible with your game patch
- Some mods may need time to update after major patches
- Check the Posts tab on Nexus for community solutions

## Mod Compatibility

### Compatible With
- Most cosmetic and equipment mods
- Class overhaul mods (generally)
- Quality of life mods
- UI enhancement mods

### Requires Attention
- Other loot distribution mods (may affect spawn rates)
- Mods that heavily modify treasure tables

### Best Practices
1. Install BG3 Mod Fixer to resolve common conflicts
2. Use BG3 Mod Manager for proper load order
3. Test in a separate save before committing to a playthrough
4. Check Nexus Posts tab for user-reported compatibility

## Balance & Design Philosophy

This mod is designed for players who enjoy powerful, build-defining items at legendary tier:

- **Power Level**: Items are intentionally powerful, suitable for endgame content
- **Uniqueness**: Each item provides distinct gameplay options
- **Build Diversity**: Items support various character builds and playstyles
- **Visual Identity**: Custom VFX make items feel special and impactful

If you find items too powerful, consider:
- Using only 1-2 items per character
- Playing on higher difficulty settings
- Using the immersive version for natural progression
